ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT
Welcome to the project! This is a site with movies, series and cartoons, created in Python and the Django platform.
More than 30 years ago, Bernie Wooder, a popular psychotherapist, developed a technique that confirms that watching feature films can be a great way to deal with emotional problems. Watching a movie is not only a way to pass the evening or an occasion to meet friends, but it is also:
1. stimulation to action, a way of motivation;
2. personal development;
3. increasing the level of cultural awareness;
4. a way to cope with difficult life situations;
5. the opportunity to live many lives;
6. charge of emotions
We hope you enjoy it and we look forward to your input!
